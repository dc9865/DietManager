Ruby - Diet Manager

Name: Daniel Cho

NOTE: Create additional Part 1 & 2 log entries 
based on the order of implementation.

================================================================
Part 1 - Product & Unit Test Classes - Start
Estimated Time	2HH 0MM
Plan for this level: 
1. Look at the instructions and lecture notes.
2. Build the frame of the code.
3. Include all the details of the code.
4. See if your program works as it has to.
5. If not, figure out where the problems come from and fix them.
6. Finish up with the entire code and run it again to test for the last time.

Part 1 - Product & Unit Test Classes - Completed
Actual Time	5HH 0MM
1. I encountered many ruby syntax understanding problems.
2. I learned how to call key and value pairs from hash functions in ruby.
3. I overcame these problems by using outside resources.
Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.

Overall Summary
Estimated Total Time	5HH 0MM
Actual Total Time	35HH 0MM
Project reflection:
1. Outside resources do not help much.
2. Diving into the depth of a programming language is hard as I didn't have any basic knoweldge of ruby.
