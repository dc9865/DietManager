NOTE: Create additional Part 1 & 2 log entries 
based on the order of implementation.

================================================================
Part 1 - Product & Unit Test Classes - Start
Estimated Time	3HH 0MM
Plan for this level:
1. Look at the instructions and lecture notes.
2. Build the frame of the code.
3. Include all the details of the code.
4. See if your program works as it has to.
5. If not, figure out where the problems come from and fix them.
6. Finish up with the entire code and run it again to test for the last time.

Project reflection:
1. Diving into the depth of a new programming language was challenging than I thought.
2. Understanding Ruby Hash structures were very challenging.
